# Number_Identification
This repository is about identifying numbers with a neural network. Additionally a user interface is implemented, so that the user can draw a number and the program is predicting which number the user has drawn.

The repository is splitted into two parts. The first program which is creating the neural network, and the other one, that is offering the mentioned user interface.

## Model
The model uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers and archives an accuracy of 99.06% on the test dataset.
